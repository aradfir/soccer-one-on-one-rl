# Training Opponent

This is a modified version of the helios base. It has been editted to always run the penalty goalie, so training can be done in play_on mode.

## How to run

To run the training opponent, you need to run the following command:
```./start.sh -n 1```
This will only start one opponent, which will be the goalie.
